# GenOtoScope

## About
GenOtoScope is a bioinformatics tool to classify the pathogenicity of variants associated with congenital hearing loss, based on ACMG/AMP guidelines.

This work was developed by [L3S Research Center](https://www.l3s.de/en), an affiliated institute of [Leibniz University Hannover](https://www.uni-hannover.de/en/), under the supervision of [Human Genetics department of Medical School of Hannover](https://www.mhh.de/en/human-genetics).


## CLI application

To annotate and classify batches of WES (.vcf) files, use the command line interface (CLI).

The GenOtoScope CLI is provided through this repository.

The usage documentation of the CLI can be found at the [wiki](https://github.com/damianosmel/genotoscope_wiki/wiki).


## Web application

To classify single variants of interest, use the [web application](https://genotoscope.mh-hannover.de:5000/).

The GenOtoScope web interface is hosted by the [Human Genetics department of Medical School of Hannover](https://www.mhh.de/en/human-genetics) at: [GenOtoScope web](http://193.174.104.231:5000/home).

The usage documentation of the web interface is provided through the same link.
